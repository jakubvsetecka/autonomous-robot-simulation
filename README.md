This project is a simulation and visualization of a autonomous and controlled robot in a discrete linear environment with obstacles and collision detection. The autonomous robots are controlled by a simple algorithm that enables them to navigate through the environment and avoid obstacles and other robots. The project is implemented in C++ and uses the Qt framework for visualization and controls of the controllable robots as well as controls of the environment. The state of the environment can be saved and loaded from a file.
